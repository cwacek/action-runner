## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Deploy via CDK construct

The system SHALL provide two AWS CDK stacks for deploying the complete solution: a foundation stack for long-lived infrastructure, and an application stack for the webhook API and application resources.

#### Scenario: Two-stack deployment
- **WHEN** a user deploys the system for the first time
- **THEN** they first deploy `SpotRunnerFoundationStack` to create VPC and private key secret
- **AND** then create a GitHub App on GitHub (without webhook URL)
- **AND** then download the private key from GitHub and upload it to the foundation stack's secret
- **AND** then deploy `SpotRunnerStack` with GitHub App ID and foundation stack references
- **AND** then update the GitHub App settings with the webhook URL and secret from the app stack outputs

#### Scenario: Foundation stack deployment
- **WHEN** a user instantiates `SpotRunnerFoundationStack`
- **THEN** the stack creates VPC, NAT gateway, and runner security group
- **AND** creates a Secrets Manager secret with a placeholder value for the GitHub App private key
- **AND** outputs the private key secret ARN for the application stack

#### Scenario: Application stack deployment
- **WHEN** a user instantiates `SpotRunnerStack` with foundation resources and GitHub App ID
- **THEN** the stack creates an API Gateway REST API with the webhook endpoint
- **AND** generates a webhook secret and stores it in Secrets Manager
- **AND** deploys all application resources (Lambdas, DynamoDB, Image Builder)
- **AND** imports the private key secret from foundation stack
- **AND** outputs the webhook URL and webhook secret value for GitHub App configuration

#### Scenario: Customized CDK deployment
- **WHEN** a user provides optional parameters (custom runner configs, timeout values, spot strategy)
- **THEN** the application stack applies those customizations
- **AND** validates parameter combinations

### Requirement: Minimal required configuration

The system SHALL require only essential configuration for deployment.

#### Scenario: Required parameters only
- **WHEN** deploying with only required parameters

  - Job timeout: 1 hours
  - Provisioning timeout: 10 minutes
  - Default runner config: `m5.large`, Amazon Linux 2023

### Requirement: Secure secrets management

The system SHALL manage sensitive configuration in Secrets Manager, with the private key uploaded by the user after GitHub App creation and the webhook secret generated by the application stack.

#### Scenario: Private key secret in foundation stack

- **AND** the user downloads the private key from GitHub
- **AND** the user uploads the private key to the foundation stack's Secrets Manager secret

#### Scenario: Webhook secret in application stack
- **WHEN** the application stack is deployed
- **THEN** the webhook secret is generated using Secrets Manager's generateSecretString
- **AND** the webhook secret value is output for GitHub App configuration

#### Scenario: Secrets access in application stack
- **WHEN** the application stack is deployed
- **THEN** it imports the private key secret by ARN from the foundation stack
- **AND** Lambda has IAM permissions to read both secrets

#### Scenario: Secrets rotation
- **WHEN** a user rotates the GitHub App private key
- **THEN** they generate a new private key on GitHub
- **AND** upload the new private key to Secrets Manager
- **AND** the system uses the new key on next token generation

### Requirement: IAM least privilege

The system SHALL create IAM roles with minimal required permissions.

#### Scenario: Lambda execution role
- **WHEN** the Lambda function executes
- **THEN** it has permissions only for:
  - DynamoDB read/write to its table
  - EC2 RunInstances, TerminateInstances, DescribeInstances for
    instances it made itself (using tag logic).
  - Secrets Manager read for its secrets
  - SSM Parameter Store read for runner configs
  - CloudWatch Logs write

#### Scenario: EC2 instance profile
- **WHEN** a runner instance executes
- **THEN** it has permissions only for:
  - EC2 TerminateInstances (for self-termination)
  - CloudWatch Logs write
  - Secrets Manager read (for JIT token if not in user data)

### Requirement: VPC configuration options

The system SHALL require VPC and security group to be provided from the foundation stack.

#### Scenario: Foundation-provided VPC
- **WHEN** the application stack is instantiated
- **THEN** the `vpc` property is required and must reference the foundation stack's VPC
- **AND** the `runnerSecurityGroup` property is required and must reference the foundation stack's security group

#### Scenario: No VPC creation in application stack
- **WHEN** the application stack is deployed
- **THEN** it does not create any VPC resources
- **AND** it uses the VPC and subnets from the foundation stack for all resources

### Requirement: Output essential configuration values

The system SHALL output values needed for GitHub App setup from the appropriate stack.

#### Scenario: Foundation stack outputs
- **WHEN** foundation stack deployment completes
- **THEN** the stack outputs:
  - Private key secret ARN (for application stack reference and manual upload target)
  - VPC ID
  - Runner security group ID

#### Scenario: Application stack outputs
- **WHEN** application stack deployment completes
- **THEN** the stack outputs:
  - Webhook URL (for GitHub App configuration)
  - Webhook secret value (for GitHub App configuration)
  - Lambda function ARN
  - State table name

### Requirement: Application stack required parameters

The system SHALL require the GitHub App ID, Server URL, and foundation stack references for the application stack.

#### Scenario: Required parameters
- **WHEN** deploying the application stack
- **THEN** `githubAppId` and `githubServerUrl` are required as external inputs
- **AND** `vpc`, `runnerSecurityGroup`, and `privateKeySecret` are required from the foundation stack

#### Scenario: No webhook URL or secret required upfront
- **WHEN** deploying the application stack
- **THEN** no webhook URL or webhook secret input is required
- **AND** the stack generates and outputs these values

### Requirement: Configuration status monitoring

The system SHALL provide visibility into configuration completeness via the status API.

#### Scenario: Missing private key detection
- **WHEN** the status API is called
- **AND** the GitHub App private key secret contains a placeholder value or is empty
- **THEN** the response includes `configuration.privateKeyConfigured: false`
- **AND** the overall status is `degraded`
- **AND** the message includes "GitHub App private key not configured"

#### Scenario: Complete configuration
- **WHEN** the status API is called
- **AND** the GitHub App private key secret contains a valid PEM key
- **THEN** the response includes `configuration.privateKeyConfigured: true`
- **AND** the configuration status does not affect the overall system status

#### Scenario: Webhook handler with missing private key
- **WHEN** a webhook request is received
- **AND** the GitHub App private key is not configured
- **THEN** the handler returns a 503 Service Unavailable error
- **AND** the error message indicates the private key needs to be configured

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Runner presets replace default runner config

The system SHALL replace `defaultRunnerConfig` with a `presets` array where each preset defines a complete runner configuration coupled with its Image Builder pipeline.

#### Scenario: Preset-based configuration
- **WHEN** a user deploys the stack with a `presets` array
- **THEN** each preset creates:
  - An Image Builder pipeline for the runner image
  - An SSM parameter at `/spot-runner/configs/<preset-name>`
  - A DynamoDB record tracking AMI build state

#### Scenario: Preset configuration structure
- **WHEN** defining a preset
- **THEN** the preset includes:
  - `name`: Unique identifier for the preset
  - `architecture`: CPU architecture (`x86_64` or `arm64`)
  - `instanceTypes`: Array of EC2 instance types (optional, can be tag-based)
  - `labels`: Additional labels for workflow matching (optional)
  - `additionalDockerImages`: Images to pre-pull (optional)
  - `timeout`: Job timeout override (optional)

#### Scenario: Single source of truth
- **WHEN** a preset is defined in CDK
- **THEN** both the Image Builder component recipe and SSM runner config derive from the same preset definition
- **AND** users do not manually edit SSM parameters

### Requirement: SSM parameters managed by stack

The system SHALL create and manage SSM parameters for runner configurations, replacing manual SSM setup.

#### Scenario: SSM parameter creation on deploy
- **WHEN** the stack deploys with a preset
- **THEN** an SSM parameter is created at `/spot-runner/configs/<preset-name>`
- **AND** the parameter contains a placeholder AMI ID initially

#### Scenario: SSM parameter structure
- **WHEN** the SSM parameter is read
- **THEN** it contains JSON with `amiId`, `instanceTypes`, `labels`, `timeout`, and other preset config values

#### Scenario: No manual SSM editing required
- **WHEN** the system is deployed and operational
- **THEN** users never need to manually update SSM parameters
- **AND** AMI IDs are automatically populated by the AMI lifecycle system

### Requirement: Preset validation

The system SHALL validate preset configurations at synthesis time.

#### Scenario: Duplicate preset names
- **WHEN** two presets have the same name
- **THEN** CDK synthesis fails with a clear error message

#### Scenario: Invalid architecture
- **WHEN** a preset specifies an unsupported architecture
- **THEN** CDK synthesis fails with a clear error message

#### Scenario: Empty presets array
- **WHEN** the presets array is empty and no defaultRunnerConfig is provided
- **THEN** CDK synthesis fails indicating at least one runner configuration is required
